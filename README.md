# Shinkai Improvement Proposals (SHIP)

SHIPs define new standards/features/functionality for the Shinkai ecosystem. These can range from setting standards for how Vector Resources should be served across the web, to new protocols on top of the Shinkai network itself.

## Getting Started

Anyone can create a new PR which submits a new SHIP underneath the `SHIPs` folder in this repo. Please follow the standard as set out in the [template](/template-ship.md) and label the SHIP with an incremented number.
